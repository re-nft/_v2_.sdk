# Examples

To ensure validity of these examples, make sure that `package.json`'s dependencies are same versions as those in renft/sdk. Talking here about ethersproject and viem versions. Otherwise, you may be getting nonsensical type errors (such as 'Wallet' type cannot be assigned to 'Signer' type, even though 'Wallet' type extends 'Signer').
